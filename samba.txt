-s – Recourse subdirectories contained within the path specified using /p and check them as well. Remove if you don’t want to delete files in subdirectories.
-m – The search mask to be used for the file type you want to check the date on (*.* being all files).
/d – The date to compare the files. Also can be used (dd/mm/yyyy) a standard date type.
/c – The command to be used on a file that matches the /m and /d criteria.
/q – Used within /c to instruct the del command to delete files quietly.
